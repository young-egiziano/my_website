          <h3>Computer technician</h3>
          <p>
            This was the first real passion for me since i was 9 years old, then
            i assembled my first computer, from that moment on I continued to
            cultivate my passion, year after year until it also became a job for
            me, I know most of the common problems, both software and hardware,
            and i'm expert enough to fix them.

          <h3>Front end developer</h3>
          <p>
            My interest started a few years ago, but I decided to start a career
            this year, and with start2impact this was possible, I chose the
            front end because I can do it with more passion, I like to create
            original sites, I adapt the look, fonts and colors depending on the
            message I want to convey to the user, ad esempio in questo sito ho
            usato pochi colori, un design minimale ma allo stesso tempo
            accattivante, simile a quello dei computer ad alte prestazioni.

          <h3>Designer</h3>
          <p>
            I think it's a needed skill for a front end developer to know at
            least the basics of design, for example, for the logos of this page
            i used cut and merge and export functions of photoshop, i learned
            from start2impact platform the basics of design and editing
            softwares like Photoshop and Illustrator, and i love making simple
            projects on Canva, but i'm still curious about this argument, so i
            think i'm going to learn more about Design on this platform.
